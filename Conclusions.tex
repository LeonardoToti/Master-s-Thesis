\section{Conclusions}


BHs are astrophysical objects that are mathematically defined as exact solutions to the EFEs. A binary BHs is a system composed of two BHs orbiting around each other. Throughout this process, GWs are emitted, causing the orbital separation to decrease and eventually leading to the coalescence of the two BHs. This merger event results in the formation of a remnant BH.
